	Modern technology allows us to expand on game ideas in ways that <br />
	the creaters on the games could have only imagined.  Not only has<br />
	computing power increased exponentially since Asteroids was created,<br />
	new sensors and equipment have been invented to make user experiences<br />
	more immersive. Nowadays it in not just science fiction to create an<br />
	Asteriods game in VR where each asteroid is a planet with its own randomly<br />
	generated ecosystem with A.I. capable of evovling over time in a simulated<br />
	universe with concievably infinite possible experiences for the user stumble upon.
