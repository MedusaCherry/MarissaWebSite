<p>
Asteroids is a classic game combining quick timing a decision making in order to avoid obstacles.<br />
The mechanics are inherently simple but the potential combinations of possible asteroid collisions<br />
is staggering so long as the appearence and size of the asteroids are randomly generated. This allows<br />
the player to get a taste of a vast and infinite universe within a incredibly simple game 2d game.
